# Main Manual

## 2.1 Basic

<h2>IMPORTANT!</h2>

<h3> Please run test first before you run main.m or multi_main.m! And intergration test and functional test may not all pass due to limit of test computer performance. For reference, a possible computer CPU and RAM combination is :
</h3>

<h3>- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800x @ 4.3GHz-4.9Ghz</h3>

<h3>- RAM: 32GB DDR4 3200 mhz</h3>

In development folder, open `main.m` and run it. The system will begin to run. If you want to use concurrency version and try grasp ticket competitively, you should run `multi_main.m` instead. At beginning, there will be a UI show up as picture below.

There are 4 section in the UI. The `1` section is the 12306 main UI. The `2` section is time controller. The `3` section is train location monitor and `4` monitor is train seat left monitor. `2`, `3`, `4` are all backend UI.

Like the real world 12306, the front page of the app is inquiry. 

- User can see the date on the upper left corner. But choosing different date can't pose effect on ticket. The time in one day is based on the time on upper right corner (i.e. if the time on upper right stays in one day, then the system will regard the operations take place in one day).
