# System Objective

​		In this project,  we are developing a software that simulates the real world 12306 train ticket system in the scope of two railways as well as a interface to control system time and observe train state.

​		This software offers user the chance to experience buying, canceling, rescheduling train ticket and watch the backend changes as well as train state changes. User can also competitively buy the ticket in multi terminals, and operate on their tickets promptly.

# Domain Analysis

​		The participants of activities of the system can be categorized into three groups: user, 12306 app and system backend monitor.

​		The relationship among different participants are shown as follows:

# System Architecture

​		From the information above, we will design a software system that simulates the transaction process: Build the 12306 and backend monitor interface, allow users to interact with interface.

​		For further detail, in file structure there are `Account.m` and `Consult.m` respectively for deal with account and inquiry that go for App processor.  `ConsultResult.m` is a non-handle class used as a struct. `Ticket.m` and `Database.m` are for system database. `Clock.m` is for system time calculations. Finally, `view.mlapp` is system UI and other`.csv` file is for data storage and will be written back from class every 2 seconds and after closing the app.
